Logic Explanation:
*Problem solver function gonna be 'solveProblem2'*
1. We will go from the first node (the root) and check if it is even-value, if it is
we will add its grand node value to sum
2. After that we will check the left, right node and repeat the same process
*We need to check if node is null many times because I think it is neccessary*

Performance:
Time: 0.28499999825726263
Space complexity: O(2^n)

Performance Enhacing Way:
Some way to check if it is null or not from farer node that we do not have to
get in the node to check
