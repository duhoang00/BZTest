Logic Explanation:
1. First loop from i to array length - 1
2. Inside that loop gonna be another loop from i + 1 to array length
3. We gonna check if element of first loop is equal to the element of the second loop,
if it is true the flag gonna be true and exit the loop because that is the duplicate element
4. If there is any member with FALSE flag, it is the result

Performance:
Not gonna be so good because the first loop have to loop through some same elements for at least 3 times 

Performance Enhacing Way:
Can use some es6's way like filter to create an array of duplicate element and do something more with it
